# Pretty Sprinklers

**Ribbon:** Modify tab → SG panel → **Pretty Sprinklers**
**Class:** `SgRevitAddin.Commands.Modify.PrettySprinklersCommand`

## Purpose

Places an **opaque head-symbol overlay** family coincident with each selected
sprinkler head, so the plan head symbol reads solid instead of having pipe /
branch lines run through it. Recreates HydraCAD's "Pretty Sprinklers."

Run with **no sprinklers selected** to **remove all** head overlays from the
active view (a toggle-style cleanup).

## How the overlay is chosen

For each selected sprinkler, the command reads its **type** (Symbol) graphics
parameters to decide which head symbol to use:

1. The checked `Symbol - HeadN` Yes/No parameter (`Symbol - Head1` … `Symbol - Head29`).
2. If none is checked, it parses the `HeadSymbol` text parameter (e.g. `Head02.png`).

That number *N* selects the overlay family named **`HeadN`** (e.g. `Head2`; a
zero-padded `Head02` is also accepted). Overlay families are category **Sprinkler
Tags** and must be loaded in the project.

## Color by workset

On a **workshared** model, running the command (with sprinklers selected) opens
a dialog. A mode radio at the top picks:

- **Standard** — just place the opaque head symbols (the original behavior).
- **Workset → Color** — place the symbols **and** color each overlay by the
  **workset its sprinkler head is on**.

In Workset mode, pick a color per workset in the grid (click a color cell), or
hit **Auto-color from workset names** to seed each from the construction-status
palette (existing = grey, demo = red, modify = orange, new = green). Choices are
remembered per workset name.

Coloring is a **per-instance view graphic override** on the overlay — so three
heads of the same `HeadN` family on three different worksets can read three
different colors in the *same* view, with no extra families or types. It recolors
only the symbol's **lines**, so the circle pattern/design that distinguishes head
types is preserved (the masking-region background and line weight are untouched).
Because it's a view override on an annotation, it applies to the **active view
only** and does not export to Navisworks (annotations never do).

**Remove Coloring** clears the overrides from every head overlay in the view but
leaves the overlays in place. On a model that isn't workshared, the command skips
the dialog and just places the symbols (no worksets to color by).

## Workflow

1. Select the sprinklers to prettify (in the active view).
2. Run **Modify → Pretty Sprinklers**.
3. Choose **Standard** or **Workset → Color** (+ colors), then **Place**.
4. An opaque `HeadN` overlay is placed at each head (and colored by workset).
   Re-running replaces the overlay already at a selected head (no stacking).
5. Run again with **nothing selected** to remove every head overlay in the view.

## Summary

Reports overlays placed, overlays colored by workset, overlays replaced,
sprinklers skipped (no head symbol resolved or the `HeadN` family isn't loaded),
and any missing overlay family names to load.

## Notes

- The overlay is placed as a view annotation at the sprinkler's location.
- Skipped sprinklers usually mean the sprinkler type has no `Symbol - HeadN`
  checked / no `HeadSymbol`, or the matching `HeadN` family isn't loaded.
- Runs through an `ExternalEvent` (`DeferredActionHandler`) since the Modify-tab
  button fires outside Revit's API context.
